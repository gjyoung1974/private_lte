# .csv to store UE's information in HSS
# Kept in the following format: "Name,Auth,IMSI,Key,OP_Type,OP/OPc,AMF,SQN,QCI,IP_alloc"
#
# Name:     Human readable name to help distinguish UE's. Sniffed from UE messages.
# Auth:     Authentication algorithm used by the UE. Valid algorithms are XOR
#           (xor) and MILENAGE (mil)
# IMSI:     UE's IMSI value.
# Key:      UE's key, where LTE authentication is used.
# OP_Type:  Operator's code type, either OP or OPc
# OP/OPc:   Operator Code/Ciphered Operator Code
# AMF:      Authentication management field
# SQN:      UE's Sequence number for freshness of the authentication
# QCI:      QoS Class Identifier for the UE's default bearer.
# IP_alloc: IP allocation stratagy for the SPGW.
#           With 'dynamic' the SPGW will automatically allocate IPs
#           With a valid IPv4 (e.g. '172.16.0.2') the UE will have a statically assigned IP.
#
